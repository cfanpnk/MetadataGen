# MetadataGen
This is a handy .NET tool I wrote for my team to consolidate database tables based on Excel spreadsheet. 

## Scenario
There are more than thousands of metadata settings on our two Oracle EBS boxes respectively. We need to consolidate the metadata settings and load them into a global single EBS box. The FNDLOAD tool provided by Oracle doesn't support merging metdata from two ERP boxes. This tool can save hundreds of hours of manual business setup by business analysts.
